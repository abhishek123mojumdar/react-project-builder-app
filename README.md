React project

Here is a basic React app which helps to manage expense

The Basic funcitonalities are

Technically it covers on a very high level

1. Components
2. Component to Component communication
3. Getting values from form
4. Rendering list
5. Using React Hook UseState
6. Event Handling

This project is a nice way to understand and start with the basics of React

As an angular developer who is trying to learn react , I will try to draw the similarities in between Angular Framework and the React library such that it we angular developers can draw references from what ever we have learnt .

Please pay attention to the comments.
